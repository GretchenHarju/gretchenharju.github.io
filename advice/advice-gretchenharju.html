			<h2>Coding is a Process</h2>
			<p>Stop thinking you have to be perfect. Perfectionism is not the goal--progress is the goal.</p>

			<h2>Getting Stuck cand lead to Breakthroughs</h2>
			<p>When I would get stuck, I felt like I couldn't move forward until I sorted out my confusion. I now know that it's all about momentum and keeping going. If I get stuck now, I let it go, I code on and I usually end up figuring it out in the process of working through other challenges.</p>

			<h2>Find a Mentor</h2>
			<p>Don't let your fears about being a beginner keep you from seeking help. You won't sound stupid. Even experienced coders were in your shoes once. They haven't forgotten and will love to help you make progress and learn. I need to give a special shout-out to my sister Brigitte for encouraging me along the way.</p>
